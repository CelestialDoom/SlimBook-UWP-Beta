***
This is the BETA version of [SlimBook UWP](https://github.com/CelestialDoom/SlimBook-UWP), this version is where I test out new layouts before they go into the main version.
***
SlimBook UWP Beta is a UWP app for Windows 10 Mobile to allow the user to access Facebook.

Small memory footprint, open source, and forever free.

**Not** recomended for heavy users of Facebook.
***
This app has the Facebook TOP BAR locked permanently, and I've removed ads.
If anyone wants the ads added back in, I'll look into it.
***
This app is **NOT** associated in **ANY** way with Facebook, Inc.
